# Easy-Dance-Classification

Used Sparse Temporal Sampling on Georgia Tech's Let's Dance database and experimented with data augmentation before feeding it into a
customised 3D Mixed Convolution ResNet 50 Model, trained to classify the randomly sampled, mute, video frames into 10 dance categories.
Contested Georgia Tech's claim that the videos in their database were visually overlapping and thus indistinguishable based on frames.
